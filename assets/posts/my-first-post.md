# My first personal post!

This is my first post on my new blog at my new personal website layout. I made this new layout to study the [GitHub Api](https://developer.github.com/v3/), so, this post that you are reading came from a markdown file [here](https://github.com.br/leandrosimoes/leandrosimoes.github.io) at my personal website github repository!

## How did you do that?

Well, as a said before, I made this blog just for study, and I'll post here just some personal thoughts. If you want to see more technical posts, you can check my [Medium Blog](https://medium.com/@leandrossimoes).

Tks a lot guys! See ya!
