# Sorry About That!

OMG! In my last post I was so excited about solve the server issues that I forget to say that I really wish you guys a Happy New Year! I hope that all your wishes come true!

### What about the parties?!

Well, I was in Santos beach on the last day of the year, I saw the fireworks at the beach and was so beautiful and peaceful! I love fireworks and everytime that I saw I keep looking and thinking about cool things and I just lost my mind in good thoughts and everything looks like is in slow motion... yeah, was a good vibe there in the beach.

### And now?!

Well, now I'm in São Paulo, working from here becaouse my girlfrind is working here in São Paulo too, so we are staying in an AirBnb house, and she is working in a University next here and I'm working here in the house. 

So this is it guys, sorry to be so late to this wishes! haha

See ya!
