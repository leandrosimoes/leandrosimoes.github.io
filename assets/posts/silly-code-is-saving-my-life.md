# Silly code is saving my life!

That's right! Making some silly codes is saving my life these days!
Some days ago I said that I'm having a really anoying throuble with my creativity, and I just can't think anything interesting to code. Well, last week I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpWsBCaJQQ8) video at [fun fun function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q) channel (that by the way is my favorite channel for now), and in this video he just said that he usualy make some "silly side projects", and how that made him keep studying, even if was just a little bit of study, but it is a every day study! So, these days I just start to made silly codes too and I'm learning so much with this, and this is keeping me studying and learning and is really cool!

### But, why?

Well, I always take some time thinking in what project I have to work, and if these projects are a big idea or just a silly idea that I was not really working, I was strougling in my thoughts and this was not working at all! So I decide to do this silly codes to keep me active on code, on GitHub and everything else. By now I found [this](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/) javascript exercices and every day I try to do one or two of them and it's really working for me by now! Every day I do a "silly" exercise but this "silly" exercice is keeping me working and learning!

That's all folks!

See ya next time!
