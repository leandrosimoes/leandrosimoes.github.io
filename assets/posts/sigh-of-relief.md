# Sigh of Relief!

Finally we found the solution for our server problems that drives me crazy last week! OMG I'm so relief! Now I can sleep again after amost two weeks!

### WTF was the problem?!

Well, was a query that hangs the DB server so hard that another queries was getting timeout exception and than the latency was increasing up to the sky and etc etc etc

### WOOHOOO!

YEAH BABY YEAH! Now we can get back to another features and stuff that we have to do to improve our app! So, Let's work!!!
