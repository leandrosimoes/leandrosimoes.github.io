# Shame On Me!

Well, I'm really disappointed by myself because I just stop to work on my GitHub projects and contribute. I know that is not just my fault, because I'm working a lot these days, but I'm disappointed anyway.

I really like to work for me, to work on my personal projects, to contribute to the open source community and I just stop to doing that. I get home so tired from work that I can't think in anything.

### Hope!

Yeah, I hope that I can get back to work on my stuff and contributte more. So, let's try again...
