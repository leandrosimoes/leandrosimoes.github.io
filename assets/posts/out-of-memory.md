# Out Of Memory!

These days I've working a lot! Some days I'm so tired that I get home and just can't think in anything else. It's like my brain get an "out of memory" exception and I could do anything else.
I really don't know how I'm writing this post right now.

### Why are you so tired?!

Well, I'm working for a startup these days and we are having some troubles with server requests getting stucked and we have no idea about what is the cause of this. So we have worked a lot, migrating some major functions to a API in another server, changing the endpoints requests of our web platform, mobile apps and everything to point this API at same time that we have to watch out the old server to know if the requests are getting stucked etc etc etc.

### Sorry about that!

I know! This post sucks, but I really can't think anything else to write right now, so...

Well, I'll go to sleep now cause tomorrow I've to work more! rsrs

Tks, and good night!
