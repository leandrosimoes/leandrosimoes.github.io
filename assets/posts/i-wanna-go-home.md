# I Wanna Go Home!

PLEASE, I WANNA GO HOME, PLEASE! 
This is my only thought in the last two or three days! Seriously, I can't handle São Paulo anymore. It's not about the city, I really like the city, but I miss my home, my dog, my shower, my air conditioner! Oh Gosh! My f* air conditioner! Me and my wife rent this AirBnb place that doesn't have air conditioner neither a single ventilator! In the beginning the weather here was helping, because was rainning and cold, but these last days the weather is so hot! And I'm that kind of person (fat) that always feels hot, even in winter. But it's not just my fault, because any city in state of São Paulo is about 10deg Celcius minimum in the winter season and now, in summer it's about 40deg Celsius!!! Can you believe that?!
And my wife has this "aventure" behavior when she is here in São Paulo, she want to go out every single day at night to know some places but I'm not sleeping well and I'm so tired and we ended fighting and bla bla bla.
Oh Dear! This week it's being sucks!

### So, When Do You Go Home?

Well, if everything goes well at my wife's work, we'll go home next sunday by the lunch time, and I really hope that this dream comes true.

Tks guys, see ya!
